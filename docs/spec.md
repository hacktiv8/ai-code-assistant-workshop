# Idea Storage Web App Specification

## Project Overview
A web application designed to capture and retrieve user-generated ideas using a clean and efficient user interface, built with a mobile-first, minimalist, neo-brutalist design approach.

## Tech Stack
- **TypeScript:** Static typing for enhanced code reliability and maintainability.
- **React:** Component-based library for building a responsive front-end.
- **Vite:** For fast development and deployment environments.
- **LocalStorage:** Client-side storage for persisting user data.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework to implement styling.

## Features and Requirements

### User Interface
1. **Main Page Components:**
- **Idea Input Form:** Simple text input with a submit button.
- [ ] Text input field with a placeholder, e.g., "Enter your idea here..."
- [ ] Submit button to save ideas.
- **Search Functionality:**
- [ ] Real-time search that filters ideas based on content as the user types.
- **Idea Display Area:**
- [ ] Ideas presented as cards beneath the input form.
- [ ] Static display; no edit or delete options.

2. **Design Guidelines:**
- Mobile-first, responsive layout.
- Light-themed neo-brutalist design using Tailwind CSS.
- Minimalist style with intuitive UI components.

### Architecture
- **Components:**
- `MainPage.tsx`: Houses the form, search bar, and idea list.
- `IdeaCard.tsx`: Renders each idea in card format.
- **State Management:**
- Use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for managing local state and effects.

### Data Handling
- **localStorage:**
- Store and retrieve ideas as plain text strings within `localStorage`.
- Maintain a key-value structure for easy access and retrieval (e.g., `ideas` key for storing serialized array of ideas).
- **Custom Hook:**
- `useLocalIdeasStorage`: Handles reading from and writing to `localStorage`.

### Error Handling
- Graceful Handling:
- **Input Errors:** Prevent submission of empty ideas via form validation.
- **Storage Errors:** Handle any potential storage issues with fallbacks and user notifications if localStorage is unavailable or unsupported.

### Testing Plan
- **Unit Testing:**
- Test components in isolation using a library like Jest and React Testing Library, ensuring correct rendering and functionality.
- **Integration Testing:**
- Validate that components work seamlessly together, particularly form input, search functionality, and data storage.
- **UI/UX Testing:**
- Ensure responsive and consistent behavior across devices and screen sizes.
- Verify compliance of the UI with design specifications.
- **User Testing:**
- Conduct tests for edge cases, such as large input sizes and rapid successive inputs, to ensure reliability.

## Deployment
- Use a platform like Netlify or Vercel for easy and continuous deployment.
- Ensure configurations support responsive design and asset optimization.
